- Performance benchmarks
- User adoption count
- Issue resolution time

### Key Questions After Each Milestone
1. What SQL patterns are users trying that fail?
2. What's the #1 blocker for adoption?
3. How long does migration take?
4. What features do users not care about?
5. What surprised us?

---

## Feedback Loops
