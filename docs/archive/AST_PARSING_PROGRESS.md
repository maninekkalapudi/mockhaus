# AST Parsing Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring Mockhaus to use sqlglot's AST parsing instead of regex-based parsing for Snowflake-specific SQL statements.

## Current Branch
- **Branch Name**: `snowflake-ast-parsing`
- **Created From**: `master` after merging data ingestion features

## Implementation Strategy
- Keep both regex and AST parsing implementations
- Make parsing method configurable via `use_ast_parser` parameter
- Default to regex parsing for backward compatibility
- AST parsing available as opt-in feature

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

4. **Add performance benchmarks comparing AST vs regex parsing methods** (low)
   - Add performance benchmarks for all statement types
   - Document performance characteristics
   - Compare memory usage and execution time

## Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `src/mockhaus/snowflake/ast_parser.py` - AST parsing implementation
- `tests/test_ast_parser.py` - Unit tests for AST parser
- `tests/test_configurable_parsing.py` - Comparison tests for both parsers

#### Modified Files
- `src/mockhaus/snowflake/ingestion.py` - Added configurable parsing for all statement types
- `src/mockhaus/executor.py` - Added `use_ast_parser` parameter
- `src/mockhaus/cli.py` - Added CLI extensions for stage and format management
- `src/mockhaus/snowflake/copy_into.py` - Integrated AST parsing with copy translator

### How to Use AST vs Regex Parsing

```python
# Default behavior (uses AST parsing)
executor = MockhausExecutor()

# Enable AST parsing explicitly
executor = MockhausExecutor(use_ast_parser=True)

# Use legacy regex parsing
executor = MockhausExecutor(use_ast_parser=False)
```

### AST Parser Advantages

1. **Handles quoted identifiers**: `CREATE STAGE "My Stage With Spaces"`
2. **More robust parsing**: Better error messages and edge case handling
3. **Easier to extend**: Adding new properties is straightforward
4. **Future-proof**: Can leverage sqlglot improvements

### Testing

All tests pass with both parsing methods:
- 34 AST parser unit tests (STAGE, FILE FORMAT, COPY INTO)
- 11 configurable parsing comparison tests
- 20 existing data ingestion tests
- 13 original query translation tests

Total: 78 tests passing

### CLI Extensions

New CLI commands for stage and format management:
```bash
# List stages and formats
mockhaus stage list [-d database]
mockhaus format list [-d database]

# Show detailed information
mockhaus stage show <stage_name> [-d database]
mockhaus format show <format_name> [-d database]
```

Features:
- Rich table formatting with color-coded output
- Shows key properties and creation timestamps
- File listing for stages (up to 10 files with count)
- DuckDB option mapping for formats
- Persistent database support

#### AST Parser Test Coverage
- **CREATE/DROP STAGE**: 10 tests (simple, with URL, quoted identifiers, IF EXISTS)
- **CREATE/DROP FILE FORMAT**: 14 tests (CSV options, JSON, Parquet, quoted identifiers)
- **COPY INTO**: 10 tests (named formats, inline formats, user stages, options)

## Breaking Changes

### v0.2.0 - AST Parsing Default
**AST parsing is now the default parsing method** (changed from regex parsing).

**For users who want to keep using regex parsing:**
```python
# Use this to maintain previous behavior
executor = MockhausExecutor(use_ast_parser=False)
```

**Benefits of AST parsing:**
- Better handling of quoted identifiers and special characters
- More robust parsing with better error messages
- Easier to extend and maintain

**Migration needed:** None, unless you have code that specifically depends on regex parsing behavior.

## Next Steps

1. **Performance benchmarks** (optional)
   - Add performance benchmarks comparing AST vs regex parsing methods
   - Document performance characteristics and memory usage
   - Identify any performance regressions or improvements

2. **Consider deprecating regex parsing** (future version)
   - After AST parsing has been stable as default for several releases
   - Provide migration period before removal
   - Remove regex parsing code to simplify maintenance

## Summary

The AST parsing implementation is now **complete** for all major Snowflake data ingestion statements:

âœ… **CREATE/DROP STAGE** - Fully implemented and integrated
âœ… **CREATE/DROP FILE FORMAT** - Fully implemented and integrated  
âœ… **COPY INTO** - Fully implemented and integrated with copy translator
âœ… **CLI Extensions** - Complete stage and format management commands

Additional features completed:
âœ… **Configurable Parsing** - Both AST and regex parsing methods available
âœ… **CLI Management Tools** - Rich command-line interface for stage and format management
âœ… **End-to-End Integration** - All components work together seamlessly
âœ… **Comprehensive Testing** - All functionality verified with extensive test coverage

All functionality maintains backward compatibility through configurable parsing, with comprehensive test coverage ensuring both parsing methods work correctly.

**ðŸŽ‰ As of v0.2.0, AST parsing is now the default method, providing users with better parsing capabilities and complete CLI management tools out of the box!**
